# ------------- All Python notes -----------------

# --- Data types in python ---
# int ----> integer is number
# str ----> string   "hello"   'hello'      ''' hello '''   """ hello """
# float ----> float is decimal number e.g:- 98.99000
# list ----> list is like array / [] list() 
# tuple ----> (1,) tuple ()
# dict ----> dictionary {} / {'key': 'value'}
# set ----> set {'value'}
# None ----> 
# bool ----> True or False value
# Complex ----> a = 12+2j ----> the j is for the imaginary part

# Everything in the pyhton is object 

# 0b ----> binary
# 0x ----> hexadecimal
# 0o ----> octal
# 0xf ----> 25  

# --- Typecasting --- (by default it was str you have to convert into integar or in float)
# type(int(input("Hello world")))
# Output is :- int 

# Python only supports single line comment it is represented by Hash sign or Pound sign.

# Python block are indetation 

# everything in the python is object

# Mutable and immutable  
# string, numbers and tuples are immutable

# String is immutable because, Strings in Python are “immutable” which means they can not be changed after they are created. Some other immutable data types are integers, float, boolean, etc.

# list, Dictionary, set is not hashable type eg; hash[1] ---> this throw an error 
# hashable are --> string, numbers, tuple, complex.
# set and dictionary used hash.
# hash is a function that converts larger files and stores in the database.
# set is mutable and dictionary is mutable.

# function is need to 
# method needs object 
# methods works on a object data

# dictionary key should be unique and hashable
